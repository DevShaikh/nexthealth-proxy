# Coding Guidelines

- Before starting on an issue, create an estimate (in hours) and set the "Estimate" on the issue.
- Regularly update the issue's status. For example, set it to "In Progress" once it's in progress, and set it to "In Review" once you started the review process.
- Submit a pull request for each issue. Do not merge it into "main." Instead, request a review from @eduardo-valencia. He will merge the pull requests.
- Review your own code prior to creating a pull request. Make sure to check for Eslint warnings.
